# Melodeon scores

Melodeon (torader in norwegian) tunes engraved with [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org).

Back in the summer of 2022 I bought myself a used Hohner Erica "torader".
"torader" in norwegian literally translates in "two rows" and describes the two rows of buttons.
It's a diatonic instrument where each row of buttons plays the notes of one key.
My instrument plays the G key in the first row and the C key in the second.
On the bass side there are eight buttons which play the bass notes and chords related to the two keys.
The push and pull of the bellows usually generates two different tones on the same button.

All this makes it pretty interesting to figure out how to play a melody and harmony, because you need to choose which buttons to use depending on the bass/chord you want to use for the harmony and whether you need to pull or push the bellows.
